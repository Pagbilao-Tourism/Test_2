                    <p> The trail to <Strong> Iringan Falls </Strong>  starts on a dirt road left of Maharlika Highway, just after Iringan Bridge. A two-kilometer mix of trail and river trekking leads adventurers through a scenic route. Near a river junction, a right turn and a short walk past a smaller cascade reveals Iringan Falls—a single-layer, horsetail-type waterfall dropping from about 15.24 meters into a shallow, crystal-clear basin.

The catch basin is around 1.8 meters wide and only knee-deep for the average Filipino. Surrounded by layered sedimentary rocks perfect for climbing, the base is often filled with sharp, jagged stones from years of erosion. The water flows into Iringan River, which eventually joins Pagbilao Bay.

The falls are alive with nature—croaking frogs, chirping birds, and rustling lizards hidden in dense foliage. The cool air and soothing sounds offer a peaceful escape, though visitors should watch for leeches blending in with the rocks. Iringan Falls, with its intense flow and glass-like waters, is both a visual and sensory treat for nature lovers.

<br> <br> 🌟 Fun Fact: Did you know<strong> Iringan Falls</strong>  got its name from a legendary snake fight? Today, instead of serpents, it's the tourists, vloggers, and painters who are "fighting" for the best shot of this natural masterpiece!

<Strong>Kamaluya Falls</Strong> is a stunning three-tier cascade towering at around 200 feet, located deep within Brgy. Ilaya Bagumbungan. Reaching it takes a challenging four-hour trek from the barangay hall, but the reward is worth the effort.

Massive balete roots cling to the rocks, adding to the wild, untouched charm.

At the base, a plunge pool about 3 feet deep and 1.43 meters wide forms, though its size and flow vary with rainfall—making every visit a unique experience.

<strong>Amao Falls</strong> gets its name from Sitio Amao, the nearest area in Silangang Malicboy. Just a kilometer away—or about a 20-minute trek—from the DENR Region IV-A PASu office, the trail to the falls begins right behind the information center. Along the way, hikers can spot diverse flora like guyabano (Annona muricata), rattan, niyog, niyog-niyugan, and the bay-it tree.

Before reaching the base of the majestic eight-tier waterfall, visitors must climb a 4-meter-high boulder for the best view. Each tier of the cascade is spaced roughly 8 meters apart. The largest plunge pool at the bottom spans about 11.28 meters wide and reaches up to 1.5 meters deep. Just above it, the second plunge is about 6 meters wide with an estimated depth of 10 meters.

The falls are framed by rich forest vegetation, home to a variety of plant species such as the tibig (Ficus nota), balete (Ficus benjamina), malapapaya, lamio (Dracontomelon dao), tambo, and als-as (Pandanus luzonensis), making it not only a natural wonder but a biodiversity haven.

<br> <br> 🌟Fun Fact: This scenic wonder once starred in a steamy film scene with Sarsi Emmanuel—making it a real-life waterfall with a silver-screen legacy!

                        Locals whisper of a hidden underwater tunnel that leads to a distant church in either Pagbilao or Tayabas, depending on who tells the tale. Its name comes from stories of apparitions of the Virgin Mary and secret masses once held by Spanish priests atop the rock.

In earlier times, the site was used for bathing and laundry, but today it's mostly avoided. Stories of ghostly voices, towering shadow figures, and sudden unexplained illnesses keep most people away. A riprap once built by a former mayor to protect the site has mysteriously vanished—just one more piece of the puzzle surrounding this legendary landmark.

                 data-place-story="Tambak River holds a key place in Pagbilao’s history—it was once the main waterway used by Spanish expeditions, contributing to the town’s naming and early identity. Economically, it played a vital role during the time of horse-driven transport, serving as a bathing spot for horses that delivered coconuts from Brgy. Ilaya Bagumbungan to the town center, especially when roads were limited.

For residents of Brgy. Tambak, the river continues to be a lifeline—used for washing clothes and dishes, bathing, and unfortunately, even as a toilet by some. These daily routines foster strong social interaction within the community.

Spiritually, the river is home to the iconic “Altar” rock formation, believed to be the site of a Virgin Mary apparition. Though only the rock remains today, locals still light candles and offer prayers, keeping the faith and legend alive."

                    <p> <strong>Tambak River</strong> runs over 4 kilometers and connects five barangays—Mayhay, Tambak, Ikirin, Pinagbayanan, and Daungan—making it the most accessible and familiar river in Pagbilao. Despite its closeness to the town center, it remains vibrant with life, home to tilapia, catfish, and freshwater shrimp.

Locals have used its waters for generations—for bathing, washing, and even religious rituals, especially near the famous “Altar” rock where a Virgin Mary statue was once seen. During the Japanese era, it also served as a hiding place, with secret spots called pansol. Legends still speak of its mysterious depth and hidden secrets.

<br> <br> 🌟 Fun Fact:  In the 1990s, Mayor Rosauro Radovan released baby tilapia into the river—not just to clean the water, but to help nourish the community too!</p>
